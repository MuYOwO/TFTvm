# TFTvm
An exploration project to Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) simulation. The goal is to create a universal engine that supports a variety of user-defined ISAs.

TFT stands for Three-Forty-Two(342), which refers to ECE342 - COMPUTER HARDWARE @ University of Toronto, a really deep pain in the ass. The architecture used in this project is a simple processor that is implemented in one of the labs in this course.
